# NoteTaker_Website
--This is a website which helps in the creation of notes.It creates notes which can be edited,deleted and sorted at any given time.These notes can also be searched by specifying the title,date,name or all possible options available in the csv file.These notes are also marked by the date and time they were created and the task at hand.

--These notes can be used to create to-do list, daily goals and the completion of tasks at hand.These notes can also be pinned depending on their importance if needed.

--The code used to make this website are html,CSS and JavaScript.The html file acts as the frontend of both CSS and the JavaScript and it used to segregate the different sections of the website such the header,title,text make etc..The CSS file is used to style the fonts,colors,borders,size,padding,etc..

--JavaScript acts as the backbone of the whole website as it helps in the creation of notes,deploying of databoxes.It is used in the editing,deleting and adding of notes.It also helps in features such as scrolling up to the top of the website,pinning notes to the Pinned section.It is used in the drop down boxes and the redericting of the search box.Elements used for the drop down boxes,closing searchbox,search scrolland many other features are linked using the external open source elements.

--JavaScript is also used to deploy searchboxes when a Title of a given note is not entered,a note is deleted.It also ensures the user to check twice before deleting a note.JavaScript also ensures in accomodating all languages and makes sure no Error texts are thrown back while using special character like emojis,languages such as japanese chinese etc.

--JavaScript also makes sure redundency does not happen by making sure that no duplicate notes by the same title are created.This helps the user to effieciently maintain data without repetition.
These are the splitups used while developing the website.

--Split 1: Initialization of functions and variables:
        The variables and initialised and the required functions and librabries are called out and created.Then the Javascript file along with the CSS file are linked to the main "index.html" file.To make the website more accesible and user friendly CSS is used to style the fonts and reorganise all the functions in a neat and methodical way to ensure the user can easily access the site without any hinderances.      
--Split 2:Getting user input for the variables:
        The user is then required to enter the values into the Title and Body of the notes to be further maipulated by the JavaScript  
        
--Split 3:Data Processing:
          The processing done in the html files are mostly redirected to the JavaScript.In JavaScript the data is manipulated accordingly for functions such as the creation,editing,deleting of notes.It also makes sure to prevent any accidental deleting or editing of the file.It makes sure noe duplicate and void notes are created.   
          
--Split 4:Data Display:
          The data is then displayed in "Your Notes" according to the user data.These notes can be firther pinned by the user accoring to importance and prefernce.
          
Split 5:Data storing :
          The data manipulated is then stored into the csv file and then the user can acess them whenever necessary in the website and it is stored permanently until the user deletes it.
